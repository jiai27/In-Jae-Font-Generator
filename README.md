# In-Jae-Font-Generator Preface
Preface: 

The high level idea of this side project was inspired by the application developed by In-Jae Company during the first hackathon in the K-Drama Start-Up (2020). 
Therefore, all originality ideas are credited to the creators of Start-Up as I am simply just a fan trying to recreate the project practically to develop skills.
The general idea is the application takes in a human's handwriting (in the show they use handwriting from a bank's dataset), 
either in the form of image input or drawing directly on a tablet, and by using AI, generate a series of fonts that companies could use for practical and/or commercial use.

The benefits of this solution include:
- reducing the time and resources required for unique font generation 
- supplementing a sample of characters to the entire set of Korean characters in that font (this repo focuses on English only)
- able to accept multiple input forms of sample characters
