# In-Jae-Font-Generator
Preface: The high level idea of this side project was inspired by the application developed by In-Jae Company during the first hackathon in the K-Drama Start-Up (2020).
The general idea is the application takes in a human's handwriting, either in the form of image input or drawing directly on a tablet, and by using AI, generate a series of fonts that companies could use for practical and/or commercial use.
