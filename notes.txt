This text file contains notes during development.
Notes made here are purely done in bulk, what appears on README documentation is moreso a changelog / summary of what has been implemented


#---preprocessing.py---

    During gray_norm development:
        question: what would be the most advisable dimension size?
            big images get downsized, small images get upsized
            but image inputs can be of ANY size, possible solution: put constraints on input image size OR limit image size of a person's writing
        solution:
            - later in development, restrict user image inputs to max(width, height) <= 1024 (ensure if either dimensions are bigger, set it to 1024 max)
            - preserve aspect ratio
            - sentence -> word segmentation doesn't have to resize the images themselves, this'll be done in word segmentation
            - WORDS: hardcoded height set to 64px. width can vary, but stay UNDER 512px
                if original width > 512, resize it to preserve aspect ratio
    
    During binarize development:
        - currently, threshold=150 and regular cv.threshold with type THRESH_BINARY + THRESH_OTSU works nicely, though may have to be changed
